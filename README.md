# ML-SimpleLinearRegression-SeaLevelRise

### ***Overview:***

**Sea level rise** refers to the **increase in the average height of the world's oceans** over time. This phenomenon is primarily driven by two major factors related to global warming:

1. **Thermal Expansion**: As ocean water warms, it expands. Even a small increase in temperature can cause large volumes of water to expand significantly.
2. **Melting Ice**: Glaciers and polar ice sheets are melting at accelerated rates, adding more water to the oceans.

While sea levels naturally fluctuate due to tides and weather, the long-term **upward trend** observed over the past century is a direct consequence of human-induced climate change. This rise threatens coastal cities, ecosystems, and millions of lives globally, as it can lead to:
- Increased coastal flooding and storm surges
- Erosion of shorelines
- Submersion of low-lying islands and coastal cities
- Displacement of populations

So, it is necessary for us to understand how the rise is happening — particularly the slope of the trend — to evaluate the urgency of the issue and take the necessary actions. By analyzing the rate at which sea levels are rising, we can better predict future scenarios and support evidence-based policy and adaptation strategies.

### ***Background:***

Good data science (and data analysis more generally) as well as the appropriate application of machine learning algorithms depends on a clear understanding of the underlying problem/situation, the methods by which the data you are about to analyze are collected, and the situational context in which that data sits.  To that end:
